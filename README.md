# Sushi prices collection

This was my first commercial data analysis project, I was tasked with gathering competitor prices for various types of rolls. I successfully completed the project within a span of two days, and the client was satisfied with the outcome. As a result of my analysis, the company experienced a significant increase in profits, reaching up to 8% the following month.
